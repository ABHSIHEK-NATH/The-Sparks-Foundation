*Prediction Using Supervised ML*

Objective - Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours.

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning 
can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

*Working on the Analysis*

Describing the data -> Checking all the unique values since there are only two variables Hours and Scores, 
                       Checking for Missing and Duplicate values - there we neither any Missing values nor any Duplicate values.
Data Visualization -> Visualizing the Hours and Scores distribution and their corresponding relation between Hours and Scores,
                      Checking for Outliers - Hours and Scores doesnot have any outliers,
                      The Scores and Hours data shows a Normal Distribution.
Correlation Matrix -> Checking the Correlation Matrix - it shows that the variables are Highly Correlated, meaning the variables has strong relation with eachother,
                      There is a positive linear relation between number of hours studied and percentage of scores.
Using Linear Regression for training the Algorithm -> After model training the regressor.coef_: [9.68207815] and regressor.intercept_: 2.826892353899737
Creating a Prediction Model -> R2 Score is 0.9678055545167994,
                               Mean Absolute Error: 3.9207511902099244,
                               Mean Squared Error: 18.943211722315272,
                               Root Mean Squared Error: 4.352380006653288,
                               Lower MAE implies the models predicted values are close to the actual ones.

Predicting What will be the predicted score if a student studied 9.25hrs/day?
-> No of Hours = [[9.25]]
   Predicted Score = 92.38611528261494
   So if a Student is studying for 9.25 Hours a Day, then the student is likely to Score 92.38%
