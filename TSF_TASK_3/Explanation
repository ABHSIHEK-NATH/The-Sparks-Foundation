*Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail*

-> Project Overview - This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the SampleSuperstore dataset as part of the 
Data Science and Business Analytics Internship at The Spark Foundation. The objective is to derive insights from the retail data, 
understand patterns, and identify key factors affecting sales and profit.

-> Dataset Name: SampleSuperstore.csv

-> Description: This dataset contains information on orders, including sales, profit, discount, and shipping details across various regions 
and categories in the United States.

-> Analysis Steps

1. Importing Libraries: Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. Data Loading: The dataset is uploaded and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

3. Data Exploration: The dataset's dimensions, column names, and basic statistics are explored using .shape, .columns, .info(), and .describe() methods.

4. Data Cleaning 
   - Missing Values: Checked using .isnull().sum(). The dataset is clean with no missing values.
   - Duplicate Values: Found and removed using .duplicated().sum() and .drop_duplicates().
   - Unnecessary Columns: The Postal Code column is dropped as it doesn't contribute to the analysis.

5. Data Visualization
   - Pairplot: Used to visualize relationships between features categorized by Region.
   - Heatmap: Visualized pairwise correlations between numerical features to understand relationships.

6. Univariate Analysis
   - Shipping Mode: Most orders are shipped using the Standard Class, with the least using Same Day.
   - Segment: Majority of the customers belong to the Consumer segment.
   - Category: Orders are categorized into Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies.
   - Region: Western Region has the highest number of orders.

7. Bivariate Analysis
   - Sales and Profit by Category:
   - Technology has the highest sales and profit.
   - Furniture shows moderate sales but the least profit.
   - Sales and Profit by Sub-Category:
   - Copiers have the highest profit, whereas Tables show significant losses.
   - Profit by State: California contributes the most to profits, while Texas incurs the most significant losses.
   - Discount vs. Profit and Sales: Higher discounts lead to higher sales but lower profits.

8. Conclusion
   - Discounts above 30% result in losses; lower discounts tend to be profitable.
   - Sales strategies should focus on Technology and Office Supplies due to their profitability.
   - Furniture, especially Tables, should be reconsidered due to their poor profit margins.
   - States like New York and California should be targeted for increasing sales and profits.
